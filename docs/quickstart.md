 * `volume_storage_template` : (Optional) Storage template name or ID for creating the volume. Empty value will use default template.
 
### Setup Local Registry Variables

### Setup OCP Upgrade Variables

Update the following variables specific to OCP upgrade. The upgrade will be performed after a successful install of OCP.

 * `upgrade_image` : (Optional) OpenShift release image having higher and supported version. If set, OCP cluster will be upgraded to this image version. (e.g. `"quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release-nightly@sha256:552ed19a988fff336712a50..."`)
 * `upgrade_pause_time` : (Optional) Minutes to pause the playbook execution before starting to check the upgrade status once the upgrade command is executed.
 * `upgrade_delay_time` : (Optional) Seconds to wait before re-checking the upgrade status once the playbook execution resumes.


## Setup Data Files

You need to have the following files in data/ directory before running the Terraform templates.
```
$ ls data/
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  pull-secret.txt
```
 * `id_rsa` & `id_rsa.pub` : The key pair used for accessing the hosts. These files are not required if you provide `public_key_file` and `private_key_file`.
 * `pull-secret.txt` : File containing keys required to pull images on the cluster. You can download it from RH portal after login https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret.


## Start Install

Run the following commands from where you have cloned this repository:

```
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file var.tfvars
```

Now wait for the installation to complete. It may take around 40 mins to complete provisioning.

**IMPORTANT**: When using NFS storage, the OpenShift image registry will be using NFS PV claim. Otherwise the image registry uses ephemeral PV.


## Post Install

### Delete Bootstrap Node

Once the deployment is completed successfully, you can safely delete the bootstrap node. This step is optional but recommended to free up the used during install.

1. Change the `count` value to 0 in `bootstrap` map variable and re-run the apply command. Eg: `bootstrap = {instance_type = "medium", image_id = "468863e6-4b33-4e8b-b2c5-c9ef9e6eedf4", "count" = 0}`
2. Run command `terraform apply -var-file var.tfvars`


### Create API and Ingress DNS Records
You will also need to add the following records to your DNS server:
```
api.<cluster name>.<cluster domain>.  IN  A  <Bastion IP>
*.apps.<cluster name>.<cluster domain>.  IN  A  <Bastion IP>
```

If you're unable to create and publish these DNS records, you can add them to your `hosts` file. For Linux and Mac `hosts` file is located at /etc/hosts and for Windows it can be found at c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts.
```
<Bastion IP> api.<cluster name>.<cluster domain>
<Bastion IP> console-openshift-console.apps.<cluster name>.<cluster domain>
<Bastion IP> integrated-oauth-server-openshift-authentication.apps.<cluster name>.<cluster domain>
<Bastion IP> oauth-openshift.apps.<cluster name>.<cluster domain>
<Bastion IP> prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.apps.<cluster name>.<cluster domain>
<Bastion IP> grafana-openshift-monitoring.apps.<cluster name>.<cluster domain>
<Bastion IP> <app name>.apps.<cluster name>.<cluster domain>
```

**Note**: For convenience, entries specific to your cluster will be printed at the end of a successful run. Just copy and paste value of output variable `etc_hosts_entries` to your hosts file.


## Cluster Access

The OCP login credentials are in bastion host. To retrieve the same follow these steps:
1. `ssh -i data/id_rsa <rhel_username>@<bastion_ip>`
2. `cd ~/openstack-upi/auth`
3. `kubeconfig` can be used for CLI (`oc` or `kubectl`)
4. `kubeadmin` user and content of `kubeadmin-password` as password for GUI


The OpenShift web console URL will be printed with output variable `web_console_url` (eg. https://console-openshift-console.apps.test-ocp-090e.rhocp.com) on successful run. Open this URL on your browser and login with user `kubeadmin` and password as retrieved above.

The OpenShift command-line client is already configured on the bastion node with kubeconfig placed at `~/.kube/config`. Just start using the oc client directly.


## Clean up

To destroy after you are done using the cluster you can run command `terraform destroy -var-file var.tfvars` to make sure that all resources are properly cleaned up.
Do not manually clean up your environment unless both of the following are true:

1. You know what you are doing
2. Something went wrong with an automated deletion.
